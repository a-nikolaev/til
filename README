Creating a new note:
  When creating a new note in the editor, the entered text should be structured as follows:
  
    - the first line is the TITLE
    - the second line is the LIST OF TAGS (can be left empty)
    - all remaining lines is the note content

  Example:
  *----------------------------------------------------------------------*
    Apple pancakes                                                         -  title
    recipe apple pancake favorite                                          -  tagline
    1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).                      \ 
    2. Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat;               |
       cook and stir apple slices, about 1/4 cup sugar,                    |
       and cinnamon in butter until apples are tender, about 5 minutes.    |
    3. Beat eggs, milk, flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder,      > content
       vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl until batter is smooth;   |
       pour batter evenly over apples.                                     |
    4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.    |
       Run a spatula around the edges of the pancake to loosen.            |
       Invert skillet over a large plate to serve.                         /

Notes lookup:
  Command `til find [KEYWORDSLIST]` looks up for the notes that contain the 
  requested keywords in the title or in the list of tags.
  
  In other words, the difference between the title and the tag list is 
  aesthetic (when the notes are displayed, the title is shown in bright green,
  while tags are shown in dark gray). 

  The command displays only the notes with the maximum number of 
  matched keywords (that is, not all keywords must match).

Customization:
  - Change your preferred text editor in the function `edit_entry()`
    (Vim is the default editor).
  - Change the color scheme at the end of the function `run()`,
    where the notes are printed out, search for the method `colorize`.

Notes storage:
  The notes database is stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/til/notes.db
  (On Linux, it is usually ~/.local/share/til/notes.db)

Suggestions:
  If a distinction between the title text and tags is desirable, one can 
  prepend tags with a dash or underscore symbol: -recipe -apple -cinnamon
  Prepending with # will not work, since # symbols are discarded when
  matching keywords, however one can edit the regexp in `normalize_word()`
  function to preserve other punctuation symbols, in addition to - and _
